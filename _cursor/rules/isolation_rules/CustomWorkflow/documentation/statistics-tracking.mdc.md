  end_time: "2025-06-10T12:30:00Z"
  duration_minutes: 150
  complexity_level: "Level 3"
  completion_rate: 100
  quality_score: 85
  mode_transitions:
    - from: "VAN"
      to: "PLAN"
      duration: 15
    - from: "PLAN"
      to: "CREATIVE"
      duration: 45
```

**Mode-Level Tracking**
```yaml
mode_metrics:
  mode: "IMPLEMENT"
  session_count: 25
  average_duration: 120
