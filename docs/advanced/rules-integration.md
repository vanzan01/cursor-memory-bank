   - Cross-system bridge components
   - Performance optimization rules

2. **Level-Specific Rules** (On demand)
   - Loaded based on task complexity
   - Cached for performance
   - Synchronized between systems

3. **Phase-Specific Rules** (Context specific)
   - Loaded during specific workflow phases
   - Temporary loading for phase duration
   - Automatic cleanup after phase completion

4. **Integration Rules** (Bridge specific)
   - Cross-system communication rules

   - Preload based on usage patterns
   - Balance memory vs. performance

4. **Rule Compression**
   - Compress unused rules
   - Decompress on demand
   - Reduce memory usage
```

#### Token Usage Optimization
```markdown
# Token Efficiency:
1. **Rule Consolidation**
   - Merge similar rules
   - Eliminate redundancy
   - Reduce token consumption

2. **Smart Loading**

   - Skip unused rule parts
   - Implement selective loading

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Cache processed rules
   - Avoid reprocessing
   - Implement intelligent invalidation
```

### 3.3 Unified Command Interface

└── VAN.RULES.SYSTEM.VALIDATE - Cross-system validation

VAN.RULES.CURSOR[command]
├── VAN.RULES.CURSOR.LOAD - Load .cursor rules
