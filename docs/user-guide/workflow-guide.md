```

#### Step 1: VAN Mode (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Quickly identify and understand the issue

**Activities**:
- Analyze the bug report or issue description
- Locate the problematic code
- Assess the scope of the fix
- Confirm it's truly a Level 1 task

**Key Questions**:
- What exactly is broken?
- Where is the issue located?
- Will this fix affect other parts of the system?
- Can this be fixed in under 30 minutes?

**Output**: Clear understanding of the problem and fix location

#### Step 2: IMPLEMENT Mode (15-20 minutes)
**Objective**: Apply the fix quickly and safely

**Activities**:
- Make the minimal necessary changes
- Test the fix locally
- Verify no regression is introduced
- Update any relevant comments

**Best Practices**:
- Keep changes as small as possible
- Test the specific issue that was reported
- Check for similar issues in nearby code
- Document the change in commit message

**Output**: Working fix that resolves the issue

#### Step 3: REFLECT Mode (3-5 minutes)
**Objective**: Capture lessons and prevent similar issues

**Activities**:
- Document what caused the issue
- Note any patterns or root causes
- Update documentation if needed
- Consider if preventive measures are needed

**Key Questions**:
- Why did this issue occur?
- How can we prevent similar issues?
- Should we add tests or documentation?
- Are there other places with similar problems?

**Output**: Brief reflection document with lessons learned

#### Step 4: ARCHIVE Mode (2 minutes)
**Objective**: Preserve knowledge for future reference

**Activities**:
- Archive the fix details
- Tag with relevant keywords
- Link to related issues or documentation
- Update knowledge base

**Output**: Searchable archive entry for future reference

### Level 1 Example: React Form Validation Bug

```markdown
## VAN Analysis
**Issue**: Form submits with empty required fields
**Location**: `src/components/ContactForm.jsx`
**Root Cause**: Missing validation check
**Complexity**: Level 1 (simple validation fix)

## IMPLEMENT Solution
**Change**: Added validation check before form submission
**Files Modified**: `src/components/ContactForm.jsx`
**Testing**: Verified form blocks submission with empty fields

## REFLECT Insights
**Lesson**: Form validation should be checked both client and server side
**Prevention**: Add validation tests to prevent regression
**Pattern**: Similar forms may have same issue

## ARCHIVE
**Keywords**: form-validation, react, bug-fix
**Related**: Issue #123, ContactForm component
```
