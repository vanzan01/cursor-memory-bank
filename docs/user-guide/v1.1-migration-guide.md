## 🎯 New Commands Guide

### CONTINUE / ПРОДОЛЖАЙ
**When to use**: After any interruption or when starting a new session

**Example**:
```bash
# English
CONTINUE

# Russian
ПРОДОЛЖАЙ
```

**What happens**:
1. Loads your saved context
2. Restores exact working mode
3. Shows current progress
4. Resumes where you left off

### SHOW CONTEXT
**When to use**: Check current session status

**Example**:
```bash
SHOW CONTEXT
```

**Output**:
```
📊 CURRENT CONTEXT STATE
========================
🔧 Mode: IMPLEMENT (Phase 3/4)
📋 Task: Feature Development
⏱️ Session: 1h 30m active
📈 Progress: 60% complete
```

### Project Discovery Commands
```bash
SCAN RULES      # Find project rules
FIND TASKS      # Discover TODO/FIXME items
INIT PROJECT    # Complete project analysis
```

## 🔧 Updated Workflows

### Starting New Work

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CONTINUE Command Not Working
**Symptoms**: No response to CONTINUE command

**Solutions**:
1. Check if context file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la memory-bank/system/current-context.md
   ```

2. If missing, start new session:
   ```bash
   VAN
   ```

3. If corrupted, clear and restart:
   ```bash
   CLEAR CONTEXT
   VAN
   ```

#### Context File Too Large
**Symptoms**: Slow performance, large context files

**Solutions**:
1. Check context file size:
   ```bash
   ls -lh memory-bank/system/current-context.md
   ```

2. If > 50KB, clear context:
   ```bash
   CLEAR CONTEXT
   ```

3. Use more specific commands to reduce context size

#### Discovery Not Finding Tasks
**Symptoms**: FIND TASKS returns no results

**Solutions**:
1. Check file patterns:
   ```bash
   grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.md" .
   ```

2. Verify file permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la rules/
   ```

3. Use manual search if needed:
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "TODO" {} \;
   ```
