- Added QA interrupt system for handling questions during workflow

### 5. **Search Strategy Framework**
- Established 4 core search categories: Error Resolution, Feature Discovery, Best Practices, Solution Validation
- Created source evaluation criteria with priority ordering
- Implemented quality indicators for search result assessment
- Developed comprehensive search command syntax

### 6. **Documentation Integration**
- Created comprehensive web search integration guide
- Updated all existing mode instruction files with web search capabilities
- Established documentation requirements for search results
- Implemented search result integration into Memory Bank workflow
