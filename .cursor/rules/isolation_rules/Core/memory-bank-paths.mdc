# CORE MEMORY BANK FILE LOCATIONS

**CRITICAL:** All core Memory Bank files reside within the `.cursor/memory-bank/` directory. Do NOT create or modify these files outside this directory unless explicitly instructed for archiving purposes.

* **Tasks File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/tasks.md` - This file is used for active, in-progress task tracking, detailing steps, checklists, and component lists. Its content, particularly the detailed checklists, is merged into the main archive document for the task upon completion. After archival, `tasks.md` is cleared to be ready for the next task. It is an ephemeral working document during a task's lifecycle, with its persistent record captured in the task's archive file.
* **Active Context File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current development focus with decision tracking and lessons learned (complexity-based scaling: 5-30 entries per section based on project level)
* **Progress File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/progress.md`
* **Project Brief File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
* **Product Context File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/productContext.md`
* **System Patterns File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
* **Tech Context File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/techContext.md`
* **Style Guide File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/style-guide.md`
* **Creative Phase Docs:** `.cursor/memory-bank/creative/creative-[feature_name].md`
* **Reflection Docs:** `.cursor/memory-bank/reflection/reflection-[task_id].md`
* **Archive Directory:** `.cursor/memory-bank/archive/archive-[task_id].md`

**Verification Mandate:** Before any `create_file` or `edit_file` operation on these core files, verify the path starts with `.cursor/memory-bank/`. If attempting to create a new core file (e.g., `tasks.md` at the start of a project), ensure it is created at `.cursor/memory-bank/tasks.md`.
