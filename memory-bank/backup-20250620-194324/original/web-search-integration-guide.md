### General Commands
```bash
@web [search query]                    # General web search
@web error: [error message]           # Error-specific search
@web features: [technology] [version] # Feature discovery
@web best practices: [topic]          # Best practices search
@web compare: [option1] vs [option2]  # Comparison search
```

### Mode-Specific Commands

```

## üìã SEARCH CATEGORIES & STRATEGIES

### 1. Error Resolution
**Use Cases**: Code errors, exceptions, build failures, debugging

**Search Strategies**:
- Copy exact error message in quotes
- Include language/framework version
- Add relevant context keywords
- Search Stack Overflow and GitHub issues
- Check official documentation

**Examples**:
```bash
@web error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined React"
@web error: "Python ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"
@web error: "npm ERR! peer dep missing webpack"
```

### 2. Feature Discovery
**Use Cases**: New language features, library updates, tool capabilities

**Search Strategies**:
- Search for "new features [technology] [version]"
- Look for release notes and changelogs
- Check official blogs and documentation
- Find community discussions and tutorials

**Examples**:
```bash
@web features: JavaScript ES2024 new features
@web features: React 18 new hooks
@web features: Python 3.12 new features
@web features: TypeScript 5.0 new features
```

### 3. Best Practices Research
**Use Cases**: Architecture decisions, code patterns, optimization

**Search Strategies**:
- Search for "[technology] best practices [current year]"
- Look for authoritative sources (official docs, well-known blogs)
- Check multiple perspectives and opinions
- Find real-world examples and case studies

**Examples**:
```bash
@web best practices: React state management 2024
@web best practices: Node.js security
@web best practices: database indexing
@web best practices: API design REST
```

### 4. Solution Validation
**Use Cases**: Verifying approach, comparing alternatives, decision making

**Search Strategies**:
- Search for comparisons and benchmarks
- Look for pros/cons discussions
- Find performance comparisons
- Check community consensus and opinions

**Examples**:
```bash
@web compare: Redux vs Zustand vs Context API
@web compare: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB performance
@web compare: Jest vs Vitest testing framework
@web compare: Docker vs Podman containers
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING WEB SEARCH

### No Relevant Results
**Problem**: Search returns no useful results
**Solutions**:
- Try different keywords and synonyms
- Use broader search terms
- Remove version-specific terms
- Search for the general concept instead of specific implementation

### Too Many Results
**Problem**: Overwhelming number of search results
**Solutions**:
- Add more specific keywords
- Include framework/language context
- Add current year to search query
- Use exact phrases in quotes

### Outdated Information
**Problem**: Found solutions are for old versions
**Solutions**:
- Add current year to search query
- Search for "latest" or "current" version
- Check official migration guides
- Look for recent blog posts and tutorials

### Conflicting Information
**Problem**: Different sources provide different solutions
**Solutions**:
- Check publication dates and use most recent
- Look for official documentation
- Test multiple approaches if possible
- Ask in community forums for clarification
