## üîÑ INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### For VAN Mode:
When starting a new development cycle, VAN mode should:

1. **Check for migration.md**: Look for existing migration.md file
2. **Process Unfinished Tasks**: Integrate unfinished tasks into new tasks.md
3. **Preserve Context**: Maintain task context and dependencies
4. **Update Status**: Mark tasks as MIGRATED in new cycle
5. **Archive Migration**: Move processed migration.md to archive/

### For REFLECT Mode:
When analyzing completed work, REFLECT mode should:

1. **Analyze Task Status**: Categorize all tasks by completion status
2. **Identify Unfinished**: Find IN_PROGRESS, PLANNED, and BLOCKED tasks
3. **Prepare Migration**: Create migration package for unfinished tasks
4. **Document Context**: Preserve all relevant context for continuation

### For ARCHIVE Mode:
When archiving completed work, ARCHIVE mode should:

1. **Separate Completed**: Archive only completed tasks
2. **Preserve Unfinished**: Create migration.md for unfinished tasks
3. **Maintain Links**: Keep references between archived and migrated tasks
4. **Update Status**: Mark tasks appropriately in archive

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before completing migration:

- [ ] All unfinished tasks categorized correctly
- [ ] Task context and dependencies documented
- [ ] Integration instructions provided
- [ ] File references updated
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined
- [ ] Migration metrics calculated
- [ ] Validation completed

## üìù MIGRATION HISTORY

### Previous Migrations:
[Record of previous task migrations between cycles]

### Lessons Learned:
[Insights from previous migrations to improve the process]

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

After migration processing:

1. **VAN Mode**: Integrate migrated tasks into new development cycle
2. **Update tasks.md**: Add migrated tasks with MIGRATED status
3. **Archive Migration**: Move processed migration.md to archive/
4. **Continue Development**: Proceed with new cycle including migrated tasks

*This migration system ensures no tasks are lost during development cycle transitions and maintains continuity of work across REFLECT/ARCHIVE ‚Üí VAN mode changes.*
